Design Principle: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Explain how this design principle is related to "favor object composition instead of inheritance"

By dynamically composing objects, I can add new functionality by writing new code and encapsulating this code into a new object referenced by our main class.  Because Iâ€™m not changing existing code, the chances of
introducing bugs or causing unintended side effects in pre-existing code are much reduced.

What do we get when we apply the open-closed principle? (2)

[HFDP]

---

We get designs that are (1) resilient to change and (2) flexible enough to take on new
functionality to meet changing requirements.

Identify the following design pattern:

"It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically in order to extend functionality"
