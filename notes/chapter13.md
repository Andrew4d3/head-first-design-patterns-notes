Is it okay to slightly alter a pattern’s
structure to fit my design? Or am I going
to have to go by the strict definition?

Of course you can alter it. Like design
principles, patterns are not meant to be laws
or rules; they are guidelines that you can
alter to fit your needs. As you’ve seen, a lot
of real-world examples don’t fit the classic
pattern designs.

What do we need to do when we need a pattern to give a solution to a problem? (2)

[HFDP]

---

First (1) I look at the Motivation and Applicability sections (from the catalog of pattenrs) to make sure I’ve got it right. I also check the section: Consequences (2) (pros and cons). I review that to make sure there won’t be some unintended effect on my design. 

===

So, what do we need to center our thinking in? In using patterns all the time?

[HFDP]

Center your thinking on
design, **not on patterns**. Use
patterns when there is a natural
need for them. If something
**simpler** will work, then **use it**.

What shouldn't we use design pattenrs all the time? If patterns are so great, why should I be so careful about using them?

Patterns can introduce complexity, and we never want complexity where it is not needed

===

What benefits can we get of using patterns in writting documentation?

[HFDP]

As a way to share vocabulary, when you write
architectural documentation, using patterns will reduce the amount
of documentation you need to write and gives the reader a clearer
picture of the design.
